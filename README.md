# PHYS227 HW 4

**Author:** Taylor Patti

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-4-patti102.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-4-patti102)

**Due date:** 2016/03/1

## Specification

Complete the following exercise in a Jupyter notebook ```hw4.ipynb```. Using the pandas library, import the csv data file in this repository and explore the data file. The documentation GHCND_documentation.pdf may be helpful. In your notebook, do a study of the data reported by 1 particular station of your choice (that has interesting data). Plot the minimum and maximum temperatures over the reported ranges. Plot the recorded rainfall only in the month of June, 2015. Explain your findings in your notebook.

The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

This was pretty cool and not too hard (once I looked at enough of the date to realize that every entry corresponded to a different day, dur dur dur dur dur). Anyways, the one last lingering doubt I have is how to index arrays into new arrays with PANDAS in a boolean way that is more complicated than just is/isn't null. This homework was good because I learned more new stuff than I have in any homework before, but it was way shorter. That's the way to go. One, (kind of) non-trivial project > 5 book exercises.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
